# HackerU-Milestone-Project-1
A repository for my milestone project

The inspiration for this project is that in the plant I work at, we have a teams chat solely dedicated to trivia. Everyday a new trivia question is posted and the office competes.

There is a theme for each week of trivia. Last week's was bears, you thoughts are correct there were a lot of bears, beets, battlestart glattica gifs going around teams.

The issue I have with the teams trivia, is that about 2-3 months ago, the person running trivia decided, no more themes/questions centered around Movies and TV shows. That's all I know. All because it would get very "one-sided" and exclude people. Now everyone loses together.

At this point you may be thinking, well there's probably loopholes to get around that right? 

WRONG!

She called out all my favorites as examples, Marvel, Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Everything that has a book version of it in some form.

It was not radical.

And that's why I'm here to create a trivia website free from the themes, free from the ristrictions and free from boring teams.

Using the lessons learned from Front-End Development we'll make something even better than teams trivia and we'll pull from one of the best games played in an office and competed on teams with: Wordle

We'll use what we know and make it even better.
